## General Information
The US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to know:
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Dataset used is day.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
• Fall season has more bike shared compared to other seasons 
• With respect to months Bike sharing shows an increasing trend in the first half and 
decreasing towards the end of the year due to approaching Holiday season 
• Clear weather has attracted more sharing of bikes. 
• Bike sharing increases from mid of week till Saturday. 
• Sunday sees the lowest number of Bike shares as it is holiday 
• Bike share is less in holidays 
• 2019 has seen a boom increase in bike share indicating the Boombikes business growth
